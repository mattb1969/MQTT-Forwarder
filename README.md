# MQTT-Forwarder

This is a python based program that acts as a MQTT forwarder

It subscribes to topics on a particular branch and then publishes those to another

It was written to work with ThingsBoard as the community version only has a single feed for MQTT and I wanted to take the data from
many sources and publish data to it
